* __Deployment:__ Heroku, Netlify
* __Tools:__ Git

### ML Model
The model relys on PyTesseract library where the received image of the prescrition will be processed to extract the words which further undergo cleaning with the help of NLP libraries such as nltk to finally output the list of words which could possibly be medicines.
